# Introduction
  The focus for project is to study the effects of altering the parameter size used in an inference. The Dynamic Model used in this experiment is capable of altering the size of its parameter during an inference in exchange for a faster processing time and lesser energy consumption. 
  
# Software and Environment set-up installations
  Before embarking on the project, there are several software and environment set-ups that have to be done. A detailed walkthrough of all the necessary installations can be found [here](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/ai8x-training?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
